<p>This demo illustrates implementing a google map view along side a navigation drawer that slides out from the left hand side of the screen. This is a very nice, but complex UI which is nice for a lot of Google Maps applications.</p>
<p>You need a google maps API key, you can replace GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in strings.xml under /res/</p>
